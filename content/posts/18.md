Before introducing you with this topic, I would love to share- why the world is so interested in IoT (Internet of Things)

### **Why is it important?**
*	Fourth Industrial Revolution
*	IoT will touch everything
*	Everything will have IoT

IoT refers to the billions of physical devices around the world that are now connected to Internet, all collecting and sharing data.

<!--more-->

### What this **“things”** refer to?
“Things” – that are embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and system over Internet.

How an ideal IoT looks like?
*	Ubiquitous
*	Smart
*	Agile
*	On demand
*	Blend into background
*	Secure
*	Low maintenance
*	Fast
*	Upgradeable
*	Growing
*	Adaptable

Ok, you know what is IoT, let us discover – what does IoT composed of?
*	Cool applications
*	Sensors
*	Internet
*	Circuits
*	Security
*	Locomotive for innovation and economic growth
*	Big data

Let us closely observe few of these components of IoT:

### COOL APPLICATIONS:
**Smart waste management system**                                                    

This setup is at Dublin Airport

It has been able to successfully increases waste collection efficiency by 90%.

**Smart street lights**

It detects the vehicle and as per the distance of the vehicle from a particular street light, the intensity automatically gets adjusted

Wow, so cool applications!!!

But how these are becoming possible?

The answer is – **SENSORS** (Sensors convert physical to electrical signals)

### Lets us dive into the ocean of sensors:

*	Sensors can be modelled as simple mechanical harmonic oscillator
*	Most IoT sensors measure change in electrical properties: resistance, inductance, capacitance

### THINK:
*	Capacitors are great at measuring short distance with very good absolute accuracy.
*	Measurements of large displacements are better done by inductors

### **MEMS SENSORS: SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL**

    a = (k/m) ∆z = (2∏f)2∆z,                                      where, f = (1/2∏) (k/m)1/2

Looking at the first part of the equation, we might think that we should use a low k and large m
-  => low f
-  Given a constant f, only the ratio k/m~f2 is important
- A miniaturized accelerometer must have a small proof mass and a weak spring, but it is the ratio of the two that is important!
- To measure small accelerations up to a given f, we therefore have to measure Dz very accurately
- For application specific minimum detectable acceleration and bandwidth, there is a minimum detectable displacement that our position sensor must be able to measure

Small structures have position sensitivity and can be designed to have any resonance frequency


### **ELECTRIC COMPONENTS USED IN MINIATURIZED SENSORS :**

### HOW YOU THINK IS THE FUTURE?


**I THINK IT TO BE AS:**
*	Massive number of devices, only few active at a time
*	Busty traffic, few bits to transmit
*	Complexity and energy constrained
*	Node identity may not be relevant

Think on all these four points from all dimensions.

Happy learning!
