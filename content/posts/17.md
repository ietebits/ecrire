Artificial intelligence(**AI**) is one of the top trending technologies in recent times. Whether it is
amazon's **Alexa** or **Tesla's** self-driving car, they always remain in our centre of attraction.
These gadgets are based on the technology **AI.**

### But what exactly is AI?
AI is the development of computer systems that are capable of performing such tasks which
require human intelligence like decision making, object detection or solving complex
problems.

**It has mainly 3 stages-**
* **Artificial Narrow Intelligence(ANI)-** It involves machines which can perform tasks
that are pre-defined. They don't have their own thinking ability.

* **Artificial General Intelligence(AGI)-** In this, machines possess thinking ability and
make decisions just like humans.

* **Artificial Superintelligence(ASI)-** Under ASI, machines surpass human intelligence
and it can be termed as the ultimate destination of AI projects.

### When it started?
In 1950, **Alan Turing** proposed the Turing test which determines a computer can intelligently
think like a human. It was in 1956 when **John McCarthy** first coined the term **AI** and in
1959, the first **AI** lab was established at MIT.


### Where We Stand Currently?
Siri (Apple's personal assistant), Amazon's product Alexa and Tesla's self-driving car and all
such products which have been built till date upon AI technology falls under **ANI.**

### What Next?
Currently scientists and researchers are aiming for **AGI**. But experts have different opinions
about when we will achieve it. **Louis Rosenberg**(CEO of unanimous AI) predicts it will
happen by 2030. While a survey of 350 AI experts has predicted that it will occur around
2060 . But according to **Paul Allen**( Co-founder of Microsoft), **AGI** can't occur in the 21st
century. Many famous public figures like **Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking**
have termed **AGI** as a possible threat to human existence.

### Final Thoughts
It is quite clear that we have a long road ahead for **AGI**. But it is not the end. **ASI** is what we
all dream of. It is what we watch in movies. But **AGI** is the next stoppage for us and the
journey from **AGI to ASI** will be lengthier and tougher than that of **ANI to AGI**. So, **ASI**
remains hypothetical and seems like **infinity** to us.
