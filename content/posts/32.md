In the Era of evolving technology, we are seeing a large number of advanced gadgets. But there are few branches (fields) where we haven’t made major improvement. When we talk about electricity, we talk about wires, cables and different kinds of transmitter, transformers and capacitors but in near future these things are going to vanish from day-to-day life. Wi-Tricity (wireless electricity) is a technology in which we can transfer electricity without using wires and cables. Wi-Tricity is an Australian company that is consistently working towards this technology and trying hard to make our life easier.

## History of Wireless Transmission of electricity
Nikola Tesla in the year 1901, created the tower called Wardenclyffe Tower for his experiment. His initial experiment revolved around sending electricity via airwaves. But these could send electricity to a shorter distance.

Today the concept wireless transmission is used in smartphone charging. But that’s not truly wireless because for that you have to keep your phone on any surface like charging pad or charging mate. And when you pick the circuit shortens and eventually stops charging.

But imagine a room where your smartphones, laptops, TV, freeze lightbulbs gets electricity wirelessly.

Let’s see how we can do that, we know that magnetism and electricity are inter-related.

We are going to use the concept of magnetic resonance. Wikipedia explains it as a quantum mechanical resonant effect that can appear when a magnetic field and perturbed with another, oscillating electromagnetic field. It is similar as the transfer of radio waves from source (radio stations) and aligning the receiver or the sink to resonant with the radio waves of desired frequency.

Similarly the source is going to emit magnetic field and receiver is going to convert that magnetic field in AC current.


## Drawbacks of using wireless technology of electricity transfer
Creating and transmitting the magnetic field will itself consumes a certain amount of energy so we will suffer a lose of electricity.

## Conclusion
Wireless power transmission has the capability to alter our Earth in so many ways. Whether to charge a devices or
to the changing effect of global warming on this planet, wireless power transmission has an answer.

It is the most commercially viable application arising to counter the effects of global warming and the increasing demand for electricity.

Wireless Transmission through microwave will supply limitless power to earth and also open up many new opportunities for space exploration.

With Wireless power transmission through resonance and inductive coupling, emerging techno companies will able to broaden the capabilities of most electronics including phones, EVs, and many others.

By forecast, Wireless Power Transfer will be the
most marketable and sustainable alternative to any fuel power plants.

With advancements within the field happening all the time,
a worldwide wireless power transfer system may be a possibility within the near future.
