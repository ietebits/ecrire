The **UNREMOVABLE FOOTPRINTS INTRODUCTION** Do you know what footprints of
you are unremovable? No idea? Think again for some times. Again no idea?
Ok , let me give you one clue, and clue is that this is a technical
blog. Wait! wait! Are you thinking that this blog is not for you,
because you aren't a technical guy? If your answer is 'yes' then believe
me this blog is going to be very important for you.

<!--more-->

One more thing I want to say that for me this is not a blog , this is only a collection
of information, that peoples should have if they use internet. And
obviously this is also very important for technical guy. Ok! Ok! So, I
think that now you are very close to answer of the question. Yes you are
right. Obviously these footprints are not by our foot, causally I can
say these are our finger’s footprints. But, technically we call it
***"Digital Footprints"***.

Actually these are the all our online activities
like log in to any service, buy something online, online transactions,
watch something online, play game online etc. All these online activity
i.e. our digital footprints are unremovable. So what? what will I do by
knowing all these stuffs? Ok, tell me one thing that what will happen if
your footprint would remain visible and non removable with your
identity. Your privacy will vanish and you may become mad. Don't think
that privacy is the only problem due to our Digital footprints, will
discuss later after some line. Actually your digital footprints affects
our society also. How? I think you are slightly confused. Don't worry, I
am going to clear.

### WHAT IS DIGITAL FOOTPRINTS?

According to ***www.socialmediatoday.com***, over 2.5 quintillion bytes of
data are created every single day, and it’s only going to grow from
there. By 2020, it’s estimated that 1.7MB of data will be created every
second for every person on earth. Actually, when we go to online and do
something on internet, then a digital data (information) is created and
saved somewhere. Ex. when you post something in social media, like a
post, comment or share a post, chat with somebody, book tickets and any
internet activity.

You may now think that you know all about this, I
will say, please keep patience. So, even if you surfing web pages
through chrome or any browser then also a data is created. Obviously
yes, if you are using incognito mode or private browsing, then also a
data is created. I want to tell you a fact that when we use private
browsing, we generally think that no one can know what I am surfing on
web, this is our foolishness. What content you are watching or what page
you are reading if website starts with **https://**, then only you and owner
of website can know, but on what website you are watching or reading
using private browsing, are known to your service provide, wi-fi
provider, all systems between your device and server of website in the
network and any body who have basic computer networking knowledge
connected to same wifi or around you. And this is, how internet service
provider or wi-fi owner able to block websites which they want. In
simple language everything you do on internet is saved somewhere in the
world and you can't delete it like your browser history. This is called
your digital footprint. When you post or like something on social media
and after some time post is deleted, then only post content is deleted
but your digital footprint created due to this post is not deleted. Here
your digital footprint refers to what type of post you had posted or
liked.

### WHY OUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINTS ARE UNREMOVABLE AND HOW? 
But why they save our each activity although most of them are not useful for them? Answer
is, data have more value than cost of the storage hardware to store the
data. About 678,000 pages text file can be saved in 1 GB storage.
Generally they use these data to know your interest to give adds or sell
to some other organization for money or survey. These are the reasons
why your data is not deleted and your digital footprints become
unremovable. Now let us discuss how they collect ,manipulate, relate,
identify these data even we have not entered our details in the website
or app. They generally identify, collect and relate our data using
cookies and website trackers. If you are 'signed in' in at least one
app, website in a device, then other websites and apps may easily
identify you by cookies, trackers and IP address. Let us know a little
about cookies, IP address and website trackers. An HTTP cookie (also
called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie, or simply cookie) is
a small piece of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser
while browsing a website. Cookies were designed to be a reliable
mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items
added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's
browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or
recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used
to remember pieces of information that the user previously entered into
form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords, and payment card
numbers. But cookies perform essential functions in the modern web.
Perhaps most importantly, authentication cookies are the most common
method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not,
and which account they are logged in with [from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP\_cookie ).

An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the
internet or a local network. IP stands for **Internet Protocol**, which is
the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or
local network. A tracker is a script on websites designed to derive data
points about your preferences and who you are as you interact with their
site. Sometimes these scripts are placed purposefully by the website
you're on, other times a script may be from a website you've never
visited i.e. third party trackers. Know more at [Link](https://blog.mozilla.org/firefox/what-is-a-web-tracker/).

Then all data are manipulated in their systems to know your interest,
behaviour, thinking, emotional and psychological behaviour etc. They may
be able to predict you and control you, but don't worry they do not do
this, but they can. ***Source: towardsdatascience.com*** 

### IT’S AFFECT ON ME AND MY SOCIETY 
Let us discuss how our digital footprints effects our
society. Actually, when we use any services in internet then we do
promote those services unknowingly. Our each activity on the internet is
being counted like YouTube video views by websites or internet servers
even if they could not able to identify correctly us and if the counted
number is large then it is a motivation for them to scaleup their
services. This motivation may cause problem. So, if you are using only
good services on internet then you may relax, but if you are not then it
may create a big problem for us because you can't completely prevent to
leave your digital footprints or remove it later.
 
### WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
Please think once before going to do any activity on internet. Educate
your children about their digital footprint. And please encourage them
to think at least twice before posting videos, pictures, comments and
replies. Let your children know that when he likes a post, he creates
his digital footprint. If you have found this blog useful, please share
it among the peoples you care. Thank you. Be careful.
