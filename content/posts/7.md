On Sunday night when I was having a movie night with my family, I was watching the movie Mission Mangal first time after it releases, which is an inspirational story of a group of scientists who work relentlessly to make the Mars Orbiter Mission successful.

Here I saw that that they
constructed the spacecraft from a fabric that has the ability to self
repair automatically inspite of high temperature of the Sun in the Solar
System. From there, I got curious to know more about this kind of
fabrics, how they are prepared, how fabrics are turned into sensors and
what is the science behind such a technology. There is a whole array of
possibilities related to material innovation, smart and sustainable
textiles, and the latest processing technologies for the fashion
technology. So let’s explore about such type of technology:

**What exactly are smart fabrics or smart textiles?**


To understand this term in a simplest way, we define it as textile that
has been developed with new technologies that provide added value to the
wear, that can sense and react to environmental conditions or stimuli
from mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical or magnetic properties.

Just imagine how wonderful is it to charge your phone from your T-Shirt
or a textile which can create energy! Or telling your outfit that you
are feeling too hot or cold…and then they responds by cooling or heating
itself automatically. These are all within the realm of possibility with
the development of Smart Fabrics. 21^st^ century is the period of
technological revolution and with the smart textile innovations many
value additions can be made to a normal piece of textile material. There
is a huge buzz around the business of smart fabric products.


Smart textiles are also known as electronic textiles or e-textiles.
Their main motive is basically to provide added value to the user,
whether for pleasure, performance, safety, security or lifestyle
monitoring.

### Classification of Smart Textile

There are various classifications available theoretically however the
two main broad categories are: aesthetics and performance enhancement.

**1. Aesthetic Smart Textiles**

These are the textiles that use the technology mainly for the fashion
and entertainment purposes, these smart textiles incorporate unique
aesthetics into their creation from changing colors to communicating
with wearable devices through clothing. Even in the mega events across
worldwide like the New York Fashion Week, models controlled what their
dresses looked like on the red carpet through their mobile phones!

**2. Performance Enhancing Textiles**

As the name suggests itself, these textiles enhance the performance by
regulating body temperature, reducing wind resistance, monitoring heart
rate, breath rate and by controlling muscle vibrations. The advent of
this revolution provided a great boost to the athletics, sports,
military industries and healthcare sectors.

### Application of Smart Textiles

**Health**

There are wireless-enabled garment with embedded textile sensors that
allow physiological signals to be continuously monitored during normal
daily life activities. These wearable sensitized garments can
continuously monitor ECG, human heart rhythm and respiration, and other
physical activities. There are smart socks, smart baby jumpsuits and
other similar smart clothing used for medical purposes.

**Fashion and entertainment**

Because of the recent advancements in fashion technology and wearable
gadgets, smart clothing, wearable spaces, multi-functional designs and
responsive sportswear has seen significant development in recent years.

While technology may be hidden through invisible coatings and advanced
fibres, these can be used to dramatically change the appearance of the
textile by emitting light or processing light, giving new and dazzling
effects. In short, it can make you a Chameleon!

**Military**

There is always a need for real time information technology to increase
the survivability and protection of the people working in extreme
environmental conditions and hazardous situations and such requirements
can be fulfilled by these smart textiles. Beside this, these are also
used for military camouflage. Thus, these smart textiles can be used to
increase the safety and effectiveness of military forces.


**Life jacket and life belt**

Life jacket is an intelligent medical device that reads the blood
pressure or monitors the heart rate of the patients wearing it; the
information is then transferred to a computer and read by the medical
staff. In a similar way, life belt is a trans-abdominal wearable device
that facilitates the parental monitoring procedures for both the mother
and the fetus. It can access patients’ medical data at any time and can
evaluate automated preliminary diagnosis of their condition base on
collected data.

**Sports and fitness**

For sports and fitness, it is convenient for users to check their
exercise time, intensity, distance, energy consumption, breathing, body
temperature and other physiological parameters.


**There are three components that must be present in smart textiles,
these are sensors, actuators and controlling units. These components
interact with one another accordingly with the stimuli in their
environment.** These smart cloths are created by modified textile
material and miniaturized electronic devices. These clothes look like
the ordinary cloth but they have the ability to provide special function
in various situations according to the design and applications.

Now coming to the self-repairing material that we see in the movie
“Mission Mangal”
```

What they actually used was **the wolverine cloth**, ocean plastic and
gold foil with the raw material that was brought from the different
parts of India. Now, what is this wolverine cloth and what was its
significance in Mars Mission? 
> Wolverine is a self-repairing,
mechanically stretchable, conductive and transparent material that can
be electrically activated to power artificial muscles, to improve the
lifespan of batteries, electronic devices and to develop self-repairing
robots. These materials can self-repair by stitching back together. This
clothing line uses special fabric which has self-coating, it reacts to
heat and friction and reconnect the punctured hole. These materials has
many interesting properties like iron conductivity and at the same time
they can stretch 50 times its original length, they possess the ability
of self-repairing at the room temperature. The material is inspired by
the regenerative ability of the comic book villain Wolverine. 

In this age of smart fabrics, such a technology of self-healing or the
automatic repairing gave rise to the innovative ideas in the field of
smart textiles currently all over the world. Thus, smart textiles have a
wide range of applications that has made our lives far easier and
comfortable.
