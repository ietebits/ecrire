Over the past 2 century the world has witnessed some incredible
transformation. The industry that has revolutionized the modern world is AUTOMOBILE.

-   What are EVs?

-   What kind of EVs are present?

-   How does it charge?

-   How does it work?

-   Why needed?

> And many more question we have in our mind. Let’s get started:

### HISTORY

Electric vehicles initially appeared in the mid-19th century. The
invention of the primary model electrical vehicle is attributed to
numerous individuals. Rechargeable batteries that provided a viable
means for storing electricity on board a vehicle didn’t came being till
1859. The emergence of metal-oxide-semiconductor **(MOS)** technology
led to the development of electrical roads vehicles. Another vital
technology that enabled fashionable highway- capable electrical cars is
that the atomic number 3 -ion **battery (Li)**. It is responsible for
the development of electrical vehicles capable of long-distance travel.

#### Kinds of electrical vehicle (EV) :-

**Plug in electric**: This implies that cars run strictly on
electricity.

**Plug in hybrid:** These mainly runs on electricity however they
have a standard fuel engine. Therefore, you’ll be able to use petrol or
diesel too. After you run out of charge, the automobile can switch to
using fuel.

**Plug in electric:** These run mainly on fuel like hydrocarbon or
diesel however, even it has an electric battery too, that is charged
through regenerative breaking. These allows you to switch between your
fuel engine and ‘EV’ mode at touch of a button.

### CHARGING

Electric cars perform by plugging into a charge point and taking
electricity from the grid. They store the electricity in rechargeable
batteries that power an electrical motor, that turns the wheels.
Electrical cars accelerate quicker than vehicles with ancient fuel
engines – so that they feel lighter to drive.

**NEED OF EVs:**

As 6 of the world’s 10 most polluted cities are in India. Also, India’s
oil import dependence jumps to 84 percent. This depict that we need fuel
independence technology so we have EVs as a solution. EVs is the future
of the world.

***ADVANTAGES OF Electric CAR:***

**No Gas Required:** As electric car simply indicates that it
truly runs on the batteries so neither it requires any gas nor it emit
any ashes.

**A lot of Convenient:** This is because we can charge an electric
vehicle by plugging it into our home socket just like we charge other
electrical appliances.

**Savings:** These cars may be fuelled for terribly low costs and
lots of new cars can provide nice incentives for you to induce a
reimbursement from the govt for going inexperienced.

**No Emission:** 100% eco-friendly.

**Popularity:** EVs is mostly 3 times as economical as cars with an
enclosed combustion engine.

**Safe to drive:** Electrical cars endure identical fitness and
checking procedures test as alternative fuel-powered cars. An electrical
automobile is safer to use, given their lower center of gravity, that
makes them rather more stable on the road.

In case an accident happens, one will expect airbags to open up and
electricity gets released from the battery. This could stop you and
alternative passengers within the automobile from serious injuries.

**Price Effective**: Earlier, owning an electrical automobile would
price a like a getting into gold mines. However, with a lot of
technological advancements, electric car’s price and maintenance have
gone down.

**Low Maintenance**

**Reduced pollution**

**Battery life And Cost**: Battery integral a part of an electrical
vehicle. Most EVs batteries require lithium-ion one’s battery whose
price are improving day by day.

The complete capability of an atomic number 3 -ion battery i.e.,
lithium-ion cell ought to be smart for three hundred to five hundred
cycles. An honest battery might last up to ten years.

**Simple driving**: Helpful feature is regenerative braking. Also, it
uses latest technology so its mainly uses artificial intelligence which
provides hand to hand experience.

***DISADVANTAGES OF ELCTRIC CAR***

1.  **Recharge points**: Electrical fueling stations are still in
    developing Stages.

2. **The Initial Investment is Steep**: As EVs are terribly new, you
will be shocked after having glance at the sticker price of EVs.

3. **Electricity isn’t Free**

4. **Short practice range and Speed**

5. **Longer Recharge Time**

6. **Ordinarily 2 seaters**

7. **Battery Replacement**

8. **Not appropriate for cities, Facing shortage of power**

9. **Road infrastructure isn’t smart in India**

The electric automobile is comparatively new idea within the world of
the automotive trade.

### CONCLUSION

The progress that the electrical vehicle trade has seen in recent years
isn’t solely very welcome, however extremely necessary as greenhouse
gases has increased to a great extent.

The advantages of electric vehicles surpass the prices. The most
important obstacle to the widespread adoption of electric-powered
transportation is price connected, as fuel is available in the market,
are convenient, and less expensive.

Outlining the past, present and future of electric
vehicles we hope that over the course of ensuing decade, technological
advancements and policy changes can facilitate ease in the transition
from traditional fuel-powered vehicles. The belief and success of this
trade depends heavily on the worldwide population and we hope that
through mass selling and environmental education programs individuals
can feel incentivized to drive an electric-powered vehicle.

**Each person can make a difference,**

**Go electric and help make a difference.**
