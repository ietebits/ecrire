In present era in which we use wireless ear buds, landlines are replaced
by handy phones, watches are gone smart but we still use wires and
charging pads to feed electricity to our smart gadgets. But these
conventional ways of charging are going to change soon by the technology
of true wireless
charging.

**When Tesla did it 100yrs back!**

U will surprise to know that wireless charging has been around for more
then 100 years thanks to Nikola Tesla .He demonstrated magnetic resonant
coupling – the ability to transmit electricity to a small distance
through air by creating a magnetic field between two circuits, a
transmitter and a receiver which is a step ahead of electromagnetic
induction technology which we are currently using in most of our
charging pads that required a physical touch between the pad and device
for charging.

### The modern ways-

Modern research gives us 2 new methods which could revolutionized the
process of wireless charging .

1\) Radio frequency charging-It uses radio frequency which is equivalent
to our wi-fi and Bluetooth but it can supply only a few watts of power
to our devices.

2\) Infrared charging- This method uses infrared waves which can supply
more power to our devices hence the process of charging is fast.

Impact-

**Advantages of going wireless.**

-   Multi devices can be charged in a same time

-   Environmental friendly

-   Saves space

-   Saves energy

-   Saves metal

### What’s about future-

In fact this small jump in charging affects other sector such as
electric vehicles, Information Technology. It also opens the door for
cyberpunk So be ready for a wireless future .
