Cyber security is the way of practice of protecting systems, networks
and programs from digital attacks. Cyber-attacks are generally focussed
on changing, accessing or destroying useful information; extracting
money from users by unfair means; or interrupting the procedure of
normal businesses.

Cyber security protects all organizational assets from both external and
internal threats and damage which is caused by natural disasters.

An effective and efficient cyber security methods are required with
coordinated efforts across all its information systems as organizational
assets are made up of multiple disparate systems.

### SECURITY TYPES OF CYBER 

- **Network security** is used for securing a computer network from
invader, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.

- **Application security** mainly is centred towards keeping devices and
software free of threats.

- **Information security** secures the privacy of users, data and
integrity of data both in transit and in storage.

- **Operational security** focuses on the processes and decisions for
protecting data assets and handling them.

- **End-user education** looks over the most uncertain and unpredictable
cyber-security factor which is people.

**WHAT IS THE BIGGEST CYBER SECURITY THREAT TO AN AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL LIKE ME?**


 The biggest cyber threat is your email login credentials are which are
 for sale on the dark web. If your email address and password will be
 gone to the hand of cybercriminals, it can be game over when you think
 about what’s at stake.

 If you don’t want to be a victim, then turn on MFA (multifactor
 authentication) a.k.a. 2FA (two-factor authentication) in your email
 and all other accounts which you have and using it. A hacker will be
 asked for a secret code, in an addition to your login ID and password,
 when attempting to access your email.

 Your phone becomes a way to your email and other accounts. By changing
 all of your passwords routinely is another way of avoiding
 cyber-attacks. Taking these two measures will defeat a large
 percentage of personal cyber-attacks that you may be facing.

### FUTURE OF CYBER SECURITY 

 It’s a matter of concern that the rate of switch cybercrime is
 increasing. Almost every week, a high-profile cybercrime is reported.
 Every business is in its own unique stage of digital transformation;
 however, it doesn’t matter how the far your business has gone,
 security should be the top most priority as it has always been and
 will always be the first consideration in the digital world.

### CONCLUDING VIEWS 

 Cyber security is constantly evolving
 Traditional cyber security is centred on the operation of defensive
 measures around a defined perimeter. Recently competent initiative
 resembles workers and the device has brought it (BODY) policies to
 dissolve low visibility perimeter in cyber activity and at attract
 power. Despite having record levels of security today Global organisations
 are turning away from human centric cyber security to a new approach
 that focuses on changing user behaviour rather than increasing threat
 number of locations. Founded on behaviour analytics, human-centric
 cyber security provides awareness into how an end-user interconnect
 with data and extends security controls into all the systems where
 data resides, even if not exclusively controlled by the organization.
 Ultimately, this approach is assembled to identify behavioural
 anomalies in order to surface and prioritize the most serious threats
 and reducing investigation as well as threat detection times.
