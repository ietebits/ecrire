talking about social media connection or distraction. To understand this game, let's first understand both aspects of social media.

If you look at the positive aspects of social media, you can not deny how much upliftment this has
done in our society and our lives by providing multiple jobs opportunity for many of the people. 
we can connect easily from every part of the world with anyone we want that's blessing in disguise for 21st
century people. one of the recent examples for social media power everyone can feel is of coronavirus
situation. 

--------------

when whole country was in lockdown then also many sectors like educational,
entertainment (OTT) was going on through many social media platforms which was awesome for
many childrens, Citizen's and the government. Similarly many things was going on only through social
media which saved our economy by collapsing completely. now many disagree at the same time with
social media about people engagement like many of the youths get indulge in social media that they
forget about their real life by entering in virtual life. many experts says that social media is socially
distancing from everyone like two people are sitting together but both of them are looking at their
mobile screen. yes, I agree this is one of the major problem that people get started living in virtual
world but wait you can not stop the growth of the humanity like by the boom of social media everyone
getting the equal opportunities for learning, education, jobs and Many purposes which has completely
removed the geographical barrier for people so instead we should look for the ways how we can
tackle the shortcomings coming in the way of Growth like by the Good of social media it also has
come up with major shortcomings like cybercrime that was even shown beautifully in an webseries
Jamtara that was based on the Real stories and also even children nowadays getting exposed to
social media in a very early age along with youths & old that makes them vulnerable to bad people
very easily. Actually Nowadays many people develops their mindset through what they see & hear on
social media so when they like see someones photos & Videos or any kind of post mostly on
Instagram & Facebook we are aware of which ultimately most of try to put their best either by editing
or any software so people kind of started comparing themselves like they are very happy even though
they may not and I'm sad kind of thing just by watching their social media posts that's obviously is not
a good sign. Now you may say this all creating employment for many people like Influencing. yeah I
agree that's good but when rest of the people repeat these patterns of social media surfing, less likely
they become to question What they are doing and why they are doing it, that ultimately gives rise to a
new kind of disease mental health. 

------------------

Even one documentary Social dilemma have very beautifully
shown this, you can take a look Therefore We should make aware to the people about how they should
use social media for their good and not get trapped. so social media can be a connector or distractor
both it just depends on individual so for making the world a bit better we should make people aware
for the bad with the continuation of growth and humanity
