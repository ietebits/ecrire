Nanotechnology is the field of research and innovation related with building 'things' - generally,
materials and devices - on the size of atoms and molecules. A nanometre is a billionth of a metre: ten
times the diameter of a proton. The diameter of a person's hair is averagely , 80,000 nanometers. At
such scales, the standard rules of physics and chemistry not apply. as an example , materials'
characteristics, like their colour, strength, conductivity and reactivity, can differ dramatically between
the nanoscale and therefore the macro. Carbon 'nanotubes' are 100 times stronger than steel but six
fold lighter.

### What can it do?

Nanotechnology is hailed as having the potential to extend the efficiency of energy consumption,
help clean the environment, and solve major health problems. It is said to be ready to massively
increase manufacturing production at significantly reduced costs. Products this technology will be
smaller, cheaper, lighter more more efficient and require less energy and fewer raw materials to
manufacture, claim nanotech advocates

### **SOME APPLICATIONS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY**

**1. CAN BE USEFUL IN DRUG DELIVERY**

Nanotechnology could also at some point produce cheaper, more reliable path for drug-delivery. for
instance, materials that are built on the nanoscale can be capsulized that protect and secrete the
enclosed drugs during a slow and controlled manner. this might be a valuable solution in countries that
do not have adequate storage facilities and distribution networks, and for patients on complex drug
regimens who cannot afford the time or money to travel and get frequent medicine facility

**2. Nanoscale Filters for Improved Water Purification Systems**

Filters that are structured on the nanoscale offer the promise of higher water purification systems that
are cheap to manufacture, long-lasting and may be cleaned. Other similar technologies could absorb or
neutralize toxic materials, like arsenic, that poison the water bed in many countries including India and
Bangladesh.

**3. Food Security**

Using Nano sensors on Crops and Nanoparticles in Fertilizers
Tiny sensors offer the likelihood of monitoring pathogens on crops and livestock also as measuring crop
productivity. additionally, nanoparticles could increase the efficiency of fertilizers. However, Swiss
insurance firm SwissRe warned during a report in 2004 that they might also increase the power of
probably toxic substances, like fertilizers, to penetrate deep layers of the soil and travel over greater
distances.

### **SOME OTHER AREAS OF APPLICATION IN FUTURE**

1. To grow crops in hostile conditions.
2. Nano sensors on crops and nanoparticle in fertilisers.
3. Nanoscale filters can be used to clean environment.
4. Might be used in areas of renewable and sustainable energy

### **POSSIBLE EFFECT ON HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH**

The Scientist Eric Drexler, who formed the term nanotechnology, has warned of developing "extremely
powerful, extremely dangerous technologies". In his book Engines of Creation, Drexler envisioned that
self-replicating molecules formed by humans might loose our control. Although this theory has been
widely discredited by researchers within the field, many concerns remain regarding the consequences of
nanotechnology on human and environmental health also because the effect the new industry could
wear the North-South divide. Activists worry that the development of nanotechnology will progress
faster than policy-makers can make appropriate regulatory measures. they assert an informed debate
must happen to work out the balance between risks and benefits.

### **CONCLUSION**

Assessing the role of nanotechnology and guiding its progression would require cross-sectoral
involvement of scientists, governments, civil society organisations and hence the general public. Debate
is important to avoid the polarization of views illustrated by the difficulty of genetic modification. This
'blog' aims to supply a variety of relevant information for those that would really like to raised
understand and participate during this important debate.
