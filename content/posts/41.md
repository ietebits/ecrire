Technology today is emerging at a rapid pace, allowing for rapid change and development, accelerating the pace of change, until it becomes apparent. see that their role will not be the same in a world without communication tomorrow.

And an IT specialist for 2020-2021 will always be educated, uneducated and retrained. 
What does this mean for you? means staying current with new technology. It also means keeping your eyes on the future to know what skills you will need to get a secure job tomorrow and learn how to get there. Everything is bowing to the global epidemic, most IT people around the world are sitting back, working from home. And if you wish to make the most of your time at home, here are 6 new technologies to look out for and try by 2021, and perhaps protect one of the jobs that will be created by these new technologies. 

### **1) Robotic Process Automation**

Robotic automation (or RPA) is a system of automated processes based on software robots (bots) or (AI) / digital personnel. [1] Sometimes referred to as robotic software (not to be confused with robotic software) RPA tools have a strong technological similarity to the user's graphical user interface. These tools also use GUI interaction, and often do so by repeating a set of user actions performed by the user. RPA tools differ from such systems because they allow data to be managed within and between multiple systems, for example, to receive an invoice email, to extract data, and to type that into a bookkeeping system. RPA developer can earn more ₹ 534K per year - making it the next professional trend you should always be watching! 

### **2) Edge Computing**

Edge computing is a computer-assisted computer that brings calculations and data storage closer to where it is needed, improving response times and maintaining bandwidth. 
Edge computing will increase as Internet use of Things (IoT) grows. By 2022, technology trend is only meant to grow and there is little, to create a variety of jobs, especially for software engineers


### **3)Quantum Computing**

The next most notable technological phenomenon is quantum computing, which is a type of computer that takes advantage of quantum phenomena such as extraction and quantum compression. This amazing technological practice is involved in preventing the spread of coronavirus, as well as creating potential goals, due to its ability to easily query, monitor, analyze and process data, no matter where it comes from. Another field where quantum computing receives applications is banking and finance, credit risk management, frequent trading and fraud detection. 

### **4)Blockchain**

While most people think of blockchain technology in relation to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain offers useful security in many other ways. In simple terms, a blockchain can be defined as data that you can only add to, do not delete or modify. That’s why the word “chain” is because you make a series of data. Not being able to change previous blocks is what makes it so secure. In addition, blockchains are run compliant, so no single business can control data. With blockchain, you do not need a trusted third party to monitor or verify transactions. 
The average annual salary of a blockchain developer is ₹ 469K. 

### **5)IoT**

Another promising new technology is IoT. Most "items" are now built via WiFi, which means they can be connected to the Internet - and to each other. Therefore, Internet of Things, or IoT. Internet of Things is the future, and it has already enabled devices, appliances, cars and much more to connect and exchange data over the Internet. 
And we are in the early stages of this new technology trend: Predictions suggest that by 2030 about 50 billion of these IoT devices will be used worldwide, creating a large web of connected devices that integrates everything from Smartphones to kitchen appliances. Global use of Internetsuch as 5G are expected to stimulate market growth in the coming years

### **6)5G**

The next technology trend that follows IoT is 5G. Where 3G and 4G technologies allow us to browse the Internet, use data-driven services, expanded bandwidths for Spotify or YouTube and much more, 5G services are expected to change our lives. by enabling services based on advanced technologies such as AR and VR, alongside cloud-based gaming services such as Google Stadia, NVidia GeForce Now and many more. It is expected to be used in factories, HD cameras that help improve vehicle safety and management, smart grid control and smart sales as well. 
Almost every telecommunications company like Verizon, Tmobile, Apple, Nokia Corp, QualComm, is now working on creating 5G applications. 5G services are expected to be introduced globally in 2021 by more than 50 service providers providing services in about 30 countries by the end of 2021, making it a new technology that you should be aware of, and save space in.
