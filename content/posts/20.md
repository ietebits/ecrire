Since carbon dioxide being one of the major constituent of green house gasses ultimately contributing to Global warming.Therefore It becomes necessary to reduce carbon footprint in atmosphere . 

<!--more-->

Well capturing the carbon directly from the atmosphere is one of the solution .In **Carbon Capture** ,what they do is directly trap the carbon from atmosphere and turn it down into its constituent composition i.e. **Carbon** and **Hydrogen**. The obtained carbon can be used to utilise  many substances like **graphene , graphite** etc. And  the hydrogen can be utilised as a fuel with very high calorific value.

## Basically  there happens to be two types to capture carbon
1.	**Pre combustion carbon capture** ,where *CO2* is captured before diluted by other flue gasses .The fossil fuel is heated in pure oxygen , resulting as mixture of *carbon monoxide(CO)  and Hydrogen(H2)* .  The  **CO** is then heated with **water** and the **carbon** is  along with hydrogen is separated. The carbon and hydrogen can be utilised as fuel  .

2.	**Post combustion carbon capture** , where carbon is captured after the burning of fossil fuel. In this method ***CO2*** is separated  from the flue gas along with water vapor , *SO2 and N2O* . Now bubbling the gas through an absorber column packed with liquid solvents such as *ammonia*. Once the chemical in the column becomes saturated , a superheated steam around 120 °C  is passed through it . This releases the trapped *CO2*  , now it can be transported to storage below the rock gaps.

### Pre and post carbon capture can prevent 80 -90 %  of CO2  from power plants.

## What about captured carbon ?
Well one method to store captured carbon is to penetrate it deep below rock gaps , where it will remain in supercritical conditions until access to **31°C**  and **73 atm** pressure.

#### Also researchers are yet developing methods to convert this captured carbon into fuels with aim of becoming ***100% carbon neutral.**
