Over the past few decades, a lot of research and advancement has been
going on how to increase the speed of processing of data and its
storage.

Scientists and engineers are working on a two-level quantum system which
can take both the values (0, 1).

### History: -
The spark of quantum computing was brought by Richard Feynmann in 1981
when he discussed that Classical computers cannot simulate the vast
quantum world. In 1994 Peter Shor developed the 1st quantum algorithm
which could factorize large integers quicker than a classical computer
can do. In 1998 1st 2 qubit quantum computer was developed which could
solve quantum algorithms. In 2017 IBM presented 1st commercially
usable quantum computer which can be simulated from anywhere.

Recently Google and China have claimed to reach up to 56 qubits.

### Quantum Computing: -
Quantum computing uses the weirdness of quantum mechanics to solve
tedious calculations which cannot be done by simple classical computers.

It works on a two-level system called Qubit. The input data is static
but during the processing the data doesn’t remain static but exist in
multistate before observation and each state has their probability of
equal existence until the measurement where a single state remains.

### Qubits vs Classical bit: -

A qubit is a two-level system also known as Quantum bit. It is the
quantum analog of a classical bit i.e. (0, 1). It can take value |0&gt;,
|1&gt; or linear combination of both states.

A classical bit is a static bit whereas a
quantum bit is a dynamic bit. Due to its this property, it is widely
used in solving calculations of algorithms which classical bit will take
millions of years to solve and it can solve in seconds.

### Bloch Sphere And Hilbert Space: -

**Bloch sphere** is a geometrical representation of the pure
state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit), named
after the physicist Felix Bloch. It is a unit 2-sphere, with antipodal
points corresponding to a pair of mutually orthogonal state vectors. The
north and south poles of the Bloch sphere are typically chosen to
correspond to the standard basis vectors |0&gt; {\\displaystyle
|0\\rangle }|| and |1&gt;{\\displaystyle |1\\rangle }, respectively.

A **Hilbert space** is a vector space equipped with an inner product, an
operation that allows defining lengths and angles. Hilbert spaces
are complete, which means that there are enough limits in the space to
allow the techniques of calculus to be used.

Hilbert spaces support generalizations of simple geometric concepts
like projection and change of basis from their usual finite dimensional
setting.

### Quantum Superposition: -

It is a feature of a quantum system due to which it can exist in more
than one state at any instant.

Just like a wave two or more quantum states superpose to form another
quantum state.

**Ψ3= ψ**1+ **ψ2**

A quantum state is a linear combination of basis state represented in
Bra-Ket system.

**Ψ=a|0&gt; +b|1&gt;**

Basis vectors |0&gt; and |1&gt; are orthogonal vectors and squares of
coefficients ‘a’ and ‘b’ describes the probability of |o&gt; and |1&gt;
states in a quantum state.

**a\^2 + b\^2 = 1**

In Schrodinger’s Cat Experiment the probabilities of Cat to be alive or
dead are equal so the cat is in a superposition state of dead and alive.

### Quantum Entanglement : -

 It is a quantum weird phenomenon in which a group or pain of particles
are generated whose quantum states are not independent and interact even
when are at million miles apart in space. Any change in quantum state
one of the particles bring the change in the other part of the pair.

Measurement of properties like momentum, electron spin, position,
polarization etc. resembles in the entangled duo.

Researchers are working on technology that enables the transfer of
qubits between any two points. Such quantum bits can be |0&gt; and
|1&gt; at the same time, and are entangled.

-   Entanglement allows improved coordination between distant sites.
    This makes it extremely suitable for tasks such as
    clock synchronization.

-   Entanglement is inherently secure. Any two quantum bits with maximum
    entanglement, have no any share of rest environment in
    that entanglement. This makes entanglement uniquely suitable for
    applications that require security and privacy.

### Quantum Measurement: -

In Quantum Physics or Computing Measurement is an important process in
which the quantum state in the linear combination of basis states
resolves into either of the basis states i.e., |0&gt; or |1&gt;.

Before measurement a quantum particle can exist in millions of possible
combinations of basis states but during measurement it gives the exact
one possible outcome.

### Quantum Algorithm and Gates: -

**Quantum algorithms** are set of rules which runs on a realistic model
of quantum computing, using quantum circuits.

Classical algorithms are finite sequence of instructions, or a
step-by-step procedure for solving a problem, where each instruction can
be performed on a classical computer. Likewise, a quantum algorithm is a
step-by-step procedure, where each of the steps can be performed on
a quantum computer. 

What makes quantum algorithms superior is that they are able to solve
some problems faster than classical algorithms because of quantum
superposition and quantum entanglement that allows them to be
efficiently simulated on classical computers.

**Quantum logic gate** is a basic quantum circuit which works on a small
number of qubits. They are the building units of quantum circuits.

Quantum gates are basically matrices(operators) which work on eigen
vectors i.e., quantum states and gives a scalar value called eigen
values. They are reversible unlike most classical logic gates.

**Some of the important logic gates are: -**

**Pauli -X gate:** - It is a bit flip gate. |0&gt; -X- |1&gt; |1&gt; -X-
|0&gt;

**Pauli -Z gate:** - It is a phase shift gate. |0&gt; -Z- |0&gt; |1&gt; -Z-
-|1&gt;

**Hadamard gate:** - This gate creates the equal probabilities of 0 and 1.

|0&gt; -H- = (1/2)\^2 |0&gt; + (1/2)\^2 |1&gt; |1&gt; -H- = (1/2)\^2
|0&gt; - (1/2)\^2 |1&gt;

**CNOT gate:** - This gate operates on two qubits in such a way that the
first qubit serves as a control and other qubit serves as target.

**Swap gate:** - It performs half-way of a two-qubit swap. Any many-qubit
gate can be constructed from only swap and single qubit gates.

### Different Stages of Quantum Computing: -

-    **Quantum Software and circuit (Quantum Algorithms)**
-    **Classical Software and circuits**
-    **Quantum Program Compiler**
-    **Classical Control Hardware**
-    **Quantum Hardware**

### How A New Quantum World Will Look?

A quantum world with quantum computers working on a two-level system
will change the way we work. We will be much faster in calculations and
data processing; the data privacy and security will be at the next level
making it almost impossible for hackers to access data of individuals.
The quantum properties like entanglement and superposition alive the
hopes of space travel and fast transfer of information. Other than data
processing quantum bits would be capable of simulating molecular bonds
performing rapid searches of complicated databases or factorizing large
numbers very quickly. Quantum computing will modify every field from
healthcare to security, weather forecast and disaster management. It can
be understandable

### Where Do We Stand In Quantum Computing?

Different big companies like IBM, Google,
Nasa are working in development of quantum computing technologies. IBM
has its own quantum computing environment called Qiskit which can be
simulated from any corner of the world by classical computers.

In India Quantum Computing is yet to advance and only researches on
quantum computing are going on. The Department of Science & Technology
(DST) has set up QuEST or Quantum-Enabled Science & Technology (QuEST)
at an institute in Hyderabad. As indicated in the Union Budget 2020,
quantum technology is opening up new frontiers in computing,
communications and cyber security with widespread applications. The aim
is to boost research for commercial applications in quantum
technologies. Skills in quantum computing need to be developed as
objects become smarter and computers become faster.

Under the leadership of a profound Scholar
Researcher and Quantum Hardware expert Dr. R. Vijay Raghavan research on
Quantum computing and work on Quantum hardware is going on in TIFR. (The
only established experimental group in India which is working on
superconducting quantum devices known as Quantum Measurement and Control
(QuMaC) Lab in TIFR headed by him).

This group started in Dec 2012, became fully operational in Jan 2014 and
has already several important publications which include the development
of a new type of ultra-low noise broadband amplifier for quantum
measurements and a novel three-qubit quantum processor called the
"trimon".

### Conclusion: -

Quantum computing promises many possibilities and a new vision to the
world. Although no one completely understands the quantum algorithms and
how a quantum computer to be programmed. Also a little knows how it
works and processes the data, but still the researches on it makes us
await a new vision to visualize and see the quantum world. The days are
not far when quantum computing and quantum physics will change how the
world behave and may it bring new hopes for us in knowing this quantum
world in a better way.
