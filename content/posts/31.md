**Helio display** is a Hi-tech projector or display system that displays picture in air already present in the room.The system was developed by io2 technology in 2001 which is focused onto a layer of mist in mid-air,resulting in a two-dimensional display that seems to float but appears three-dimensional when using appropriate content but the image is not volumetric.Dark areas of image produced by heliodisplay appears invisible does making it look more realistic.

## History:-
The heliodisplay was invented by Mr Dyner. He built it as 5 inch interactive prototype in 2000-2001 which used a CMOS camera and IR Laser to track the position of a finger in mid-air and project its image in air. 

## Models of Helio-Display:-
*	M1
*	M2
*	M3 and M30
*	M50 and M100
*	S and L and XL
*	i Versions

### Working of Helio-Display:-

Heliodisplay transforms water into a unique screen of fine vapour suspended in mid-air to project images that create three dimensional hologram effect. It uses no additives or chemicals but only plain tap water.The system supports all those formats compatible with windows 2000, XP and Mac platforms.

### Application:-
it is used for advertising and promotion like trade shows,museum,casino display,movies. It is also used in board meetings, presentations, architectural and engineering design, virtual surgery,video games,home theatre etc.

### Conclusion:-
Helio-Display is a good projection unit as it does not require any special hardware and it creates one of the most convincing open-air holographic like images.
