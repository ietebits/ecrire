After getting into an engineering college, though interactions were online, still I was able to realize the importance of learning a “coding language”. It doesn’t matter which branch you are in, it doesn’t matter if you are interested or not, you must know at least one coding language. So, after consulting a few of my seniors, and my ***bde bhaiya*** who already is an engineer, I decided to go with the C language. Now see, the thing is, as per my observation the notion of C language among the common folks is of the ***bde bujurg*** in the family of coding languages. Many consider it to be outdated. But as a matter of fact, C is still one of the most used language for coding around the world. It indeed is one of oldest still in use programming language. So here we will be seeing the significance of C in the present world and what makes this language invincible in front of so many modern programming languages even after 50 years.

### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Let’s cover a bit of history first</span>

It was the year 1972 when C was put in front of the world by Dennis M. Ritchie, which was one of its kind. There were many programming languages before that too but they were mostly specific task based languages, like FORTRAN (1957) was meant for developing mathematical and scientific applications, COBOL (1960) was used for developing business software and so on… BPCL (1967) was the first general purpose language which was later on modified to B (1970) and then to C (1972) after eliminating some issues still pertaining in B, like introducing the function of data types which made it possible for programmers to have control over the storage of data in memory. The primary reason behind developing C was to develop Unix OS. But later on, it went up to be used for development of many other important applications.


### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Where did it go and where is it now?</span>

Many new languages popped up in the past 50 years after the arrival of C, but let me tell you, the language compilers of all those languages, which change the high level language codes to binary codes, are all coded in C. There is no programming language which is complete without C. Now, you still need any other reason for the invincibility of C in front of other languages?

Apart from this, all the database softwares that we have heard of or used like MySQL, Oracle, etc., all the text editors like Notepad, WordPad, MS Office, etc., device drivers of printers, scanner, pen drive and also the embedded programming in Microprocessors used in our daily electronic appliances like TV, fridge, washing machines, all are coded in C language. Even the viruses and antiviruses, that fascinates us a lot, are coded in C only. Most of the libraries of today’s operating systems, be it Linux, Windows, Mac or Android, and almost all web browsers are coded in C.

Isn’t it cool? How does it feel to be surrounded by so much C? How does it feel when you see the 21st century smartphone in your hand whose OS is using a half a century old developed programming language? Now it doesn’t seem that much outdated, isn’t it?


### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Why should it concern us, the Engineering students?</span>

As a beginner in programming, C language helps you to build programming skills. What does programming skill mean? In easy words, just like knowing a simple language, like Hindi, doesn’t mean that you will be able to express your thoughts in that language, knowing a programming language doesn’t mean that you will be able to solve programming problems. To express your thoughts, you need to experience first, to solve a programming problem, you need to think in that way first and that is where C helps you. C language covers the basic concepts of all the other languages, and it is only by understanding those basics that you would be able to approach the solution of a certain problem like a programmer. Not only that, this is the era of electronic devices and all the devices need embedded programming which in return is done in C. As future engineers of different fields we will definitely have to deal with electronic devices, no matter if it is mechanical or chemical, every sector is using electronics. Also, in the Campus recruitment process coding questions are asked from C only. So, it becomes inevitably important for us to learn the C language.


### <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Time to conclude</span>

Though the past decade has seen massive decrease in the use of C language, but still it has maintained a massive significance in today’s world, especially if we see it in the perspective of a world where technology changes every single day, leave aside the 50 years of C. C has played a great role in the development of many technologies of present, so it doesn’t matter how more years is it going to survive. Though its influence doesn’t seem to be decreasing soon. But this is a fast changing world, who knows? Only time will tell what it has in its lot for C.
