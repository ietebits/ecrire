Decentralization is the process of making system where no single entity
is able to own the master key and govern the data and overall system;
even they created the system. It is a powerful word in today’s society
and another feature of Blockchain that makes people hopeful about the
future where every individual will have control and power over the internet.

### Reasons For Decentralization

The next question is, why is decentralization useful in the first place?
There are generally several argument raised:

> ![1](/img/Decentralization_10/1.png)

-   **Online privacy –** our internet experience is being censored ,
    whether it is Google or social media giant like Facebook. They hold
    every user’s full name, date of birth, location, photos, work
    details, friends, and many other intimate details on their private
    centralized servers. Such centralized stores of information are
    often breached by hackers, who either sell the information or use it
    to commit crimes. The most chilling thing of all is that technically
    they can do whatever they want with our information. If they will
    use decentralized servers then our private information would
    be encrypted.

-   **Attack Resistance –** Decentralized system is more expensive to
    attack and destroy because they lack sensitive central points that
    can be attacked at much lower cost than the economic size of the
    surrounding system.

-   **Better control –** Decentralization ensures better control and
    supervision as the subordinates at the lowest level will have the
    authority to make independent decision.

-   **Relief To Top Management –** As discussed, decentralization gives
    autonomous power to subordinates. Under this, they have the freedom
    to take decision and act within the limit set by the superiors
    without frequent supervision by the superiors. All in all,
    decentralization allows the top management to focus on policy
    decisions rather than dealing with both policy and operational
    decision

**Is this something to do with the word “Blockchain” ?**

    Blockchain technology is the secure, encrypted technology that
    cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It provides a
    decentralized public digital ledger of transactions, which tracks
    ownership security in an environment without trust. While the first
    application of blockchain technology is now finding application in the
    development of the DWeb including recording the movement of data,
    registering unique user name and even data storage. There are also
    cryptocurrencies themselves being deployed to help create the DWeb.

 ### Required knowledge or Expertise:

**Some of the basic skills that will aid in becoming a successful blockchain developer are:**

-   Strong background in software development.

-   Experience working with open- source projects.

-   Experience working with large codebase.

-   Strong knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

-   Proficiency in programming languages such as C++, Java,
    JavaScript, etc.

-   Familiarity with the working of peer-to-peer networks.

-   Familiarity with basic cryptography.


**Top skills that a blockchain developer must have:**

-   Data structures

-   Blockchain Architecture

-   Smart Contract Development

-   Web Development

-   Cryptography

### Benefits Of Decentralization

-   **User don’t have to trust in a central authority-**
    Decentralization solves trust issues by empowering multiple
    participants to manage a network.

-   **Lowers risk of system failure-** In decentralized networks, no one
    node going down can take down the entire network, so no matter how
    many users come and go, your application should remain up
    and running.

-   **There is less censorship-** It is far more difficult to censor
    traffic on peer-to-peer network, in which every single outbound
    packet being sent could be communicating with another peer on the
    decentralized network, who can then forward that message along. So
    it is not easy to shut down access to anything for one’s
    own benefit.

-   **Error mitigation-** In centralized system, if any big mistake is
    made by any employee, it can cripple the whole system. But in
    decentralized network, we don’t have to worry about that one
    big mistake.

-   **Flexibility-** Decentralized organization have a great deal of
    flexibility compared to centralized ones. They can adapt to change
    or **make decisions quickly**, instead of putting every decision
    through a rigorous bureaucratic review.

-   **Market Demand**

    Market demand for this is very high as many people’s data is not
    safe and everyone wants privacy and be in a system where there is
    less censorship, less risk of system failure and less fear of
    getting hacked.

    Right now you must be wondering, if this is so good then **what’s holding it back?**

    First it is more difficult to build a decentralized web because
    everything isn’t in one place and people are used to doing all
    things in one place. Decentralized network requires more machine,
    which means more maintenance and potential issues, SO it is usually
    more expensive.

### Final Thoughts

 As we can see, decentralized network has both advantages and
 disadvantages. In this era everyone wants less disturbance, less
 censorship and more privacy. Everyone wants to avoid getting hacked.
 If we talk about disadvantages, it can be improved with time and maybe
 in future it can be more affordable. SO it can be said that
 decentralization will be the future of web.
