In the words of, Don & Alex Tapscott “The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.”   
A block chain is a digitized decentralized, public ledger. It is an incorruptible digital ledger of transactions that can be programmed to record virtually everything of value

* Blockchain technology discards the need of any third-party or Central authority for peer-to-peer transactions.
* The technology allows transactions to be anonymous, secure, peer-to-peer, instant and frictionless.
* Rather than keeping information in one central point, multiple copies of the same data are stored in different locations
* Each list of record in a blockchain is called block. So, a blockchain is a continuously growing lists of records called blocks which are linked and secured 
* On a blockchain, once a transaction is sent it is sealed and cannot be reversed.

## APPLICATIONS OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
- SMART CONTRACTS
- USE IN DIGITAL CURRENCY LIKE CRYPTOCURRENCY
- PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION
- SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
- CROWDFUNDING
- GOVERNANCE
- EDUCATION
                                   
### HOW DOES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY WORKS

> ![1](/img/Blockchain_29/1.png)

**BLOCKCHAIN technology comes under lime light with rise in popularity of CRYPTOCURRENCY all over the world like BITCOINS, GRIDCOIN, LITECOIN, RIPPLE, NEXT, DASH etc.**

### WHAT CRYPTOCURRENCY SIGNIFIES?

* It is a tradable digital asset or digital form of currencies, built on blockchain technology that only exists online.
* Cryptocurrencies use cryptography (It is the science of secret writing with the intention of keeping the data secret) to verify and secure transactions.
* The major difference between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial models is in the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies.
* This means is that when one spends a cryptocurrency, the approval of the transaction does not come from one central authority.
### ADVANTAGES OF MODERN BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
* It solves the problem of manipulation. It brings everyone to the highest degree of accountability.
* As a public ledger system, blockchain records and validate each and every transaction made, which makes it secure and reliable.
* Blockchain in-based systems allow for the removal of intermediaries involved in the record keeping and transfer of assets.
* Data entered on the blockchain is immutable, preventing against fraud.
* It allows decentralization of the technology.
### CHALLENGES FACED BY BLOCKCHAIN 
* There is no confidence in the technology it is still an innovation. Building trust in the network represents a challenge for blockchains.
* High costs and complexity of blockchain.
* Lack of understanding comes next as many executives have a vague understanding of blockchain and changes it will bring.
* Vague data regulation in countries due to poor laws and policy is one more issue.
### INDIAN EFFORTS ON BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
* NITI Aayog has built a platform called ‘Indian Chain’
* NIC has set up the Centre of Excellence(CoE) in Blockchain Technology in Bengaluru, Karnataka.
* Andhra Pradesh has become the first state in INDIA to adopt Blockchain for governance
* Yes Bank has adopted the Blockchain technology to fully digitize vendor financing
