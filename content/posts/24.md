Human Brain is one of the most valuable creation of god. Human Beings are the most intelligent and creative organism in the world . And the thing that make us different from other organism is our brain which gives us thinking capacity and capability to sustain our life in a better way.
But since death is inevitable so for sure one day we will lose the knowledge of our brain. And as we know that knowledge is the most precious thing in this era . So today scientists are in search to create an artificial brain that can think, response, take decision and keep anythings in memory.

## WHAT IS BLUE BRAIN ?

Blue Brain permits next generation brain counterfeit with performance modelling. BLUE BRAIN project is basically a swiss brain research initiative led by director Professor Henry Markram . For the first time it was founded M at Brain and mind institute named EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne) on  May 2005 . "BLUE BRAIN"- It is the name of world's first virtual brain . Which is actually a machine that can function as human brain. 


### WHY WE NEED VIRTUAL BRAIN ?

To save the intelligence, knowledge and skill of any person forever .
To upload contents of the natural brain into it to make our memory sharp and our brain more efficient .
To remember thing for a long run so that ageing does not affect our memory


### BLUE BRAIN PROJECT AIMED AT -

The main aim of Blue Brain project is to establish simulation neuroscience as a complementary approach alongside experimental, theoretical and laboratorical neuroscience to understanding the brain, by developing the world’s first biologically detailed digital simulations of the mouse brain. 

The supercomputer-based simulations and reconstructions built by Blue Brain offer a radically new approach for understanding the multi-level and complicated structure and function of the brain.

### How does the natural brain work?

The human ability to feel, interpret and even see is in control of our complicated nervous system. Yes, the nervous system is quiet complicated because we can’t see it, but it works through electric impulses through your body.

> To know more about this system, one has to know following three simple functions.

1. **Sensory input**: Receiving input such as sound , image , burning sensations etc. through sensory neurons or by sensory cells
2. **Interpretation**: It is basically interpretation of the input received by sensory neurons in the brain
3. **Motor Output**: In response of sensory input motor systems of the brain initiates body movement to perform any responses.

### How Does Blue Brain Technology Work?
Blue brain technology uses the Blue Gene supercomputer that IBM had developed to quickly start the brain simulation process. The main goal is to create a program that can upload the content of human brain to computer. So that machine can think and decide even in the absence of a human.

The human brain is highly complicated due to millions of synapses and transmissions occurring simultaneously. And in order to tackle with such complicated system IBM has created " Blue Gene supercomputer" to serve as an interface between human brain and the computer with the help of small robots or nano robots, also called nanobots.

These nanobots are small enough so they can stay and travel inside the body through the circulatory system. Those nanobots can study, monitor, and also provides updates of the brain and neuronal inter connectivity.

#### How Can One Upload Data to Blue Gene?

Brain data gets uploaded through nano bots. They follows three main steps, namely:

1. Data Acquisition
2. Data Simulation
3. Data Visualization

#### How is it possible to copy data from the brain to the computer?
The uploading is possible with the help of Nanobots. They are small enough to travel throughout our circulatory system. So they can efficiently monitor the activity and structure of our central nervous system. And can also provide an interface with computers. They can scan the structure of our brain, providing complete connections. And when this information enters into computer,then they could function like us. Thus, the entire data of the brain would be uploaded to the computer.

## Blue Brain’s Scientific Milestones
Blue Brain works on four-year road map with specific scientific milestones to achieve 

And those milestones are:
### Milestone One
The automatic machine reconstruction of the electrical behavior of all the neuron recorded in the brain.

**Importance** – this approach and respective software has become the standard for those who model neurons  as it allows our first virtual brain to automatically capture the realistic behavior of millions of neurons in the computer 

### Milestone Two
An algorithm that can recreate the connections of the microcircuit of neurons.

This algorithm had allowed the first Virtual Brain to capture the way in which neurons are connected to each other in the brain and the 3 Dimensional location of synapses in the microcircuit.

**Importance** – This was for the first time,that Blue Brain had a model to study how a neuron processes  different types of synaptic inputs 

### Milestone Three
Reconstruction as well as Simulation of Neo cortical Micro circuitry

## HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO MAKE A VIRTUAL BRAIN ?

Scientists had just created an algorithm which has a capacity of performing a complete human brain simulation. Now we just have to wait for someone to build a powerful computer which can execute it.

A human brain’s neuronal activity is incredibly complicated and simulating it at a 1:1 ratio is almost impossible with current technology.

### Advantages:

* Even after the death person’s intelligence can be saved and used.
* By interpreting  the electric impulses from the brain of the animals, their thought can be understood easily.
* With its help deaf could hear via direct nerve stimulation,
* We could use information of the brain which was uploaded into the computer and use it to provide  solution to many mental disorder.

### Disadvantages:

* There could be new types of threats, this technology would bring. 
* It would increases the dependency on computer systems.
* Computer viruses and hacker will pose an increasingly critical threat. Due to which data could be manipulated
* This may also go against the nature for eg. Human cloning could take place on large scale
