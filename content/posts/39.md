Nanotechnology is a group of all technologies and related Science used and studies in 1 to 100 nano , in the field of applied Science. Nano means materials that are made up of super-sized elements. Nanotechnology is the engineering of molecules and atoms, which combines subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, bio-informatics and biotechnology.

Nanotechnology is developing very fast in today’s time. The 21st Century is going to be the Nano Century. Today there is a competition to make the size of objects small and strong. Large-Scale research is taking place around the world to develop nanotechnology in various field. Due to the ultra-size, unmatched strength and durability, nanotechnology is creating immense potential in all fields such as **electronics, medicine, auto, bio-Science, Petroleum, Forensics, Defense, etc.**
This technology can revolutionize manufacturing, bioscience, medical science, electronics and defense, as it can make an object up to a thousand times stronger, lighter, and reliable. Nanotechnology is growing rapidly in medical and bio engineering due to its small size, superior capacity and durability. 
**Nanotechnology is the science of making ultra-fine machines.** Such machines, which can enter the human body and move in its artery and then operate the disease there. Machines that make the mobile smaller than your fingernail. Make a metal that is ten times lighter and a hundred times stronger than steel That is, the metal from which such poles can be made, which are only a few inches, but can bear the burden of the bridge.
Examples of Nanotechnology in modern use are Polymers based on molecular structures and computer chip based on Surface Science.

### **Origin of Nanotechnology** 

The first use of the principles of nanotechnology occurred in **keltech on December 29, 1959, during Richard Fiemann’s lecture at the meeting of the American Physical Association, “The Drescent of Room at the Bottom”, Fayman mentions a method in which it is Suggested to make microelectronics for the estimation of single molecules and microtubules.** He noted the decreasing effect of gravity during this and the increasing prominence of surface tension and van der waals attraction. Professor Norio Tansguchi of Tokyo science University was credited in depth in the 1980’s by Eric Drexler, who popularized the science and instruments of nano scale with his lectures and his books. Nanotechnology came from these two inventions in the 1960’s: Cluster Science and observation tunneling microscope (STM). With the help of these, fullerene in 1979 and a few years later carbon nanotubes. Synthetics and research on semiconductor nano crystals took place. This led to the invention of several non-tubes. The Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) was inverted 5 year STM.

### **Uses of Nanotechnology** 


Although there is a whirlwind of potential uses of nanotechnology, most of the commercial uses are of first generation passive methods. These include the use of titanium dioxide in Cosmetics, Silver nano particle use in canning, textile, disinfectants and household appliance, Zinc oxide nano particles using cosmetics, Paint, exterior – furniture varnishes and cerium oxide as fuel – Catalysts. 
Still it is not possible to go the next peak without doing research right now. Research on the operation of molecules at the nano level is underway to take the basic principles of the ‘Nano’ term to the level of production. But misuse of the ‘nano’ term by technical entrepreneurs and scientists can lead to a rebound. In the field of medicine with the help of nanotechnology in the field of biotechnology, it can be possible to diagnose many such disease which are still very difficult. For example, by setting up a micro plant made of nanotechnology inside the human body, the condition of human disease can be monitored closely.
Today , the daily object of every  daily life is the incorporation of nanotechnology. They have many applications in consumer goods. For example sunglasses. The Coating of glass uses nanotechnology due to which they can block even stronger and harmful UV rays much better than before. Sunscreen and other cosmetics also contain nano particles that allows light to pass through them but prevent ultraviolet rays (UV rays). They also make clothes more durable for wear, make them waterproff and wind proof. Tennis balls are also made from nano composite cores so that their bounce is more and more durable than balls made with old technology. Nano particles are used in packing such as like cartons so that the milk stays fresh in the plastic bag for longer. These are example of things that we use in our daily life.

### **Intent**


Several concerns are being expressed due to claims of widespread potential uses of nanotechnology. Due to the fear of its adverse impact on social health, the industrial production of nano materials, where the control of governance is expected, is being encouraged to encourage this research from these controls. Long – term worries are the economic ill effects on society, such as the growing economic inequalities between developed and developing nations and the post – deprivation of the economy.
The nanotechnology market is expanding rapidly, due to increasing scientific activity and increasing demand for nanotechnology in every field, in the last few years, this field is in need of immense expansion. 
Till now most of the work related to nanotechnology is being imported in India. Although research work is going on fast in the country, but so the country has not been able to become self – sufficient in this field. In such a situation, there is a lot of development in the field of nanotechnology, there will be immense possibilities for the youth in this field. At present, In addition to the country, there is a great demand for good and knowledgeable nanotechnology abroad. This is an interdisciplinary area, so the youth coming to this area need to be good in subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Maths. Due to Continuous research and development, it can be said that the coming time is of nanotechnology.
