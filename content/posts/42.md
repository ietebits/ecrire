We are now experiencing a change in reality with the emerging technology. Virtual reality is slowly being blended with our real world. This reality is much more beneficial. The day is not near when we will have a completely mixed reality. In this blog I will discuss 3 main types of reality that are emerging at very fast rate. They are-

- **Virtual Reality (VR)**
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**
- **Mixed Reality (MR)**

### **What is Virtual Reality?**

Virtual Reality (VR) is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment. Unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places the user inside an experience. Instead of viewing a screen in front of them, users are immersed and able to interact with 3D worlds. By simulating as many senses as possible, such as vision, hearing, touch, even smell, the computer is transformed into a gatekeeper to this artificial world. The only limits to near-real VR experiences are the availability of content and cheap computing power.


### **What is Augmented Reality?**

Pokémon Go creates an augmented reality experience. The game allows us to see characters bouncing around in their own town.
Augmented reality is the result of using technology to superimpose information — sounds, images and text — on the world we see. Picture the "Minority Report" or "Iron Man" style of interactivity. 


### **Augmented Reality vs Virtual Reality**

This is rather different from virtual reality. Virtual reality means computer-generated environments for you to interact with, and be immersed in.
 Augmented reality (also known as AR), adds to the reality you would ordinarily see rather than replacing it. 


**Augmented Reality in todat's world**

Google rolled out Google Glass in 2013, moving augmented reality to a more wearable interface; in this case, glasses. It displays on the user's lens screen via a small projector and responds to voice commands, overlaying images, videos and sounds onto the screen.

One of the most popular ways AR has infiltrated everyday life is through mobile games. In 2016, the AR game "Pokémon Go" became a sensation worldwide, with over 100 million estimated users at its peak, according to CNET. It ended up making more than $2 billion and counting, according to Forbes. The game allowed users to see Pokémon characters bouncing around in their own town. The goal was to capture these pocket monsters, then use them to battle others, locally, in AR gyms.


**The future of augmented reality**

Researchers are also developing holograms, which can take VR a step further, since holograms can be seen and heard by a crowd of people all at once. 


Like any new technology, AR has a lot of political and ethical issues. Google Glass, for example, raised privacy concerns. Some worried that conversations might be surreptitiously recorded or pictures snapped, or thought that they might be identified by face recognition software. AR glasses, contacts and more, like the Glass - X and Google Lens, though, are moving ahead in production and sales. 


### **What is Mixed Reality?**

A mixed-reality environment goes a step beyond augmented reality because users can interact in real-time with virtual objects that are placed within the real world. These virtual items will respond and react to users as if they were actual objects.

 
**Examples of Mixed Reality**

In order to experience mixed reality, an MR headset is used. MR headsets offer a holographic experience through translucent glasses or an immersive experience. Some mixed reality products that are currently available include Microsoft’s HoloLens, Acer Windows Mixed Reality, Lenovo Explorer, and Samsung Odyssey. It's the gesture/gaze/voice recognition technology through a pair of motion controllers or through the MR headset that helps deliver a believable mixed-reality experience. It takes a lot more processing power to enable a mixed-reality experience than it does for a virtual or augmented reality experience.



As the youngest immersive technology, awareness of mixed reality isn't incredibly high, but companies who have invested in mixed-reality projects already give us a glimpse into its potential. Ford is one company that saw the potential of mixed reality and now uses it to prototype future vehicles instead of making prototypes in a physical environment.

### **Where can we use Mixed Reality**


**Education:** Teachers can instruct students remotely by using 3D projections and simulations. 

**Training:** Nearly every industry could use mixed-reality tools to help train employees or figure out better ways of doing things. The system projects a holographic template that helps factory workers visualise all the steps in the process.

**Sports/entertainment:** From concerts that have your favorite musicians interacting with digital props to watching the action of a football game appear to go down in your living room, developers are working on many mixed-reality apps that could create these and similar experiences.

**Healthcare:** Medical professionals could view and share patient records and data in a more interactive form with mixed reality than is possible with 2D charts. As mentioned, medical students could receive training via mixed-reality applications. 


**Engineering/construction:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Mixed-reality devices could give engineers the possibility of working remotely, do 3D modelling before any expense is spent on labor and materials and more. This technology not only speeds up the design and development process but would save money as well.
