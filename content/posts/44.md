It's also a kind of electric car. It runs on a motor powered by electricity. What makes it different from a battery-electric vehicle (or BEV) is where the electricity comes from. Instead of a battery, a hydrogen fuel cell car has, well, a hydrogen fuel cell. This is a device that takes hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, and generates electricity from it while the car is running. In effect, a hydrogen fuel cell is a kind of battery that makes electricity on the fly.

### **To see how this works ?**

Hydrogen is the smallest, lightest atom in existence. A standard-issue hydrogen atom consists of two things: a proton (which has a positive electric charge) and an electron (which has a negative electric charge). The hydrogen fuel cell strips these two things apart, so that the electrons are free to go their own way and become the electricity that runs the car's motor.(Electricity Is nothing more a continuous flow of electrons.) Meanwhile, the proton becomes a hydrogen ion -- that is, a hydrogen atom with a positive electric charge -- and will bond together with any oxygen atoms in the vicinity to form water. (Water – or H2O as the chemistry geeks call it – is nothing more than two hydrogen ions with an oxygen atom attached.) This process releases a lot of heat, so the water becomes steam and the steam becomes the exhaust of the hydrogen fuel cell.

### **HYDROGEN FUEL CELL CAR IS NON POLLUTING VECHILE ?**

Well, not exactly. While neither type of car produces pollution at the tailpipe, it have the potential to produce pollution when their "fuel" is created.and the fuel that a hydrogen fuel cell car runs on is hydrogen (which is used to generate electricity).The hydrogen for the fuel cell vehicle will most likely be produced in the future by electrolysis, which involves passing electricity through water. And that electricity will come from the same potentially polluting sources as the electricity used to charge the electric car's batteries. The truth is ahydrogen fuel cell cars have the potential to be wonderfully nonpolluting forms of transportation, but to make it truly green we'll need to move away from methods of producing electricity that burn fossil fuels. Instead of burning coal to generate electricity, we'll need to concentrate on environmentally clean methods like hydropower, solar power, wind power and nuclear power, which produce little or no polluting emissions.

### **The solutions of the problems we could face if we choose hydrogen vehicle?**

Firstly, while hydrogen may be super-abundant in the universe, there’s very little pure hydrogen on Earth or in our atmosphere. That means it needs to be produced somehow. The cheapest and easiest method of producing hydrogen is to extract it from methane (natural gas), though this process also produces carbon dioxide. If the dream is a carbon-free future, this method is obviously flawed.
transporting hydrogen will be necessary, and transporting any fuel requires sticking it in big trucks (and potentially ships), which would once again need to be emissions-free for the process to be clean and carbon-free. Storing hydrogen efficiently, either on the back of a truck or underground at a service station, requires the hydrogen produced by electrolysis to be converted from a gas to a liquid, either by compressing the gas into a liquid or cooling it to liquid form. What does all this require? Yep, more energy.

What does all this require? Yep, more energy. Contrast all of this with the requirements of a pure-electric car.  The two key benefits of hydrogen cars over electric cars currently are refill/recharge speed and that dreaded EV range anxiety. Practically, they’re really only one problem, because the greater the range, the less pressing the need to charge quickly. the public infrastructure for EV recharging is significantly more advanced than the public hydrogen refueling network.
The less number of hydrogen stations. Other established markets have an equally tiny number of hydrogen stations, and even the most advanced countries only have plans for a few hundred over the next decade. Compared with hydrogen stations, electric stations are thousands of times cheaper and easier to construct.
